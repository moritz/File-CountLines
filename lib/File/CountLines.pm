=head1 NAME

File::CountLines - efficiently count the number of line breaks in a file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::CountLines qw(count_lines);
    my $no_of_lines = count_lines('/etc/passwd');

    # other uses
    my $carriage_returns = count_lines( 
            'path/to/file.txt', 
            style   => 'cr',
        );
    # possible styles are 'native' (the default), 'cr', 'lf'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<perlfaq5> answers the question on how to count the number of lines
in a file. This module is a convenient wrapper around that method, with
additional options.

More specifically, it counts the number of I<line breaks> rather than lines.
On Unix systems nearlly all text files end with a newline (by convention), so
usually the number of lines and number of line breaks is equal.

Since different operating systems have different ideas of what a newline is,
you can specifiy a C<style> option, which can be one of the following values:

=over

=item C<native>

This takes Perl's C<\n> as the line separator, which should be the right thing in most cases. See L<perlport> for details. This is the default. 

=item C<cr>

Take a carriage return as line separator (MacOS style)

=item C<lf>

Take a line feed as line separator (Unix style)

=item C<crlf>

Take a carriage return followed by a line feed as separator (Microsoft
Windows style)

=back

Alternatively you can specify an arbitrary separator like this:

    my $lists = count_lines($file, separator => '\end{itemize}');

It is taken verbatim and searched for in the file.

The file is read in equally sized blocks. The size of the blocks
can be supplied with the C<blocksize> option. The default is 4096,
and can be changed by setting C<$File::CountLines::BlockSize>.

Do not use a block size smaller than the length of the separator, that
might produce wrong results. (In general there's no reason to chose a
smaller block size at all. Depending on your size a larger block size
might speed up things a bit.)

=head1 Character Encodings

If you supply a separator yourself, it should not be a decoded string.

The file is read in binary mode, which implies that this module
works fine for text files in ASCII-compatible encodings, including
ASCII itself, UTF-8 and all the ISO-8859-* encodings (aka Latin-1,
Latin-2, ...).

Note that the multi byte encodings like UTF-32, UTF-16le, UTF-16be
and UCS-2 encode a line feed character in a way that the C<0x0A> byte
is a substring of the encoded character, but if you search blindly for
that byte you will get false positives. For example the I<LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER C WITH DOT ABOVE>, U+010A has the byte sequence C<0x0A 0x01> when
encoded as UTF-16le, so it would be counted as a newline. Even search for
C<0x0A 0x00> might give false positives.

So the summary is that for now you can't use this module in a meaningful
way to count lines of text files in encodings that are not ASCII-compatible.
If there's demand for, I can implement that though.

=head1 Extending

You can add your own EOL styles by adding them to the
C<%File::CountLines::StyleMap> hash, with the name of the style as hash key
and the separator as the value.
